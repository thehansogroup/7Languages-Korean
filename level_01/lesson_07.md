#### Vocabulary

- 이것 — This thing (close to speaker)

- 그것 — That thing (close to listener)

- 저것 — That thing over there (far from both speaker and listener)

- 여기 — Here

- 거기 — There

- 저기 — Over there

- 이 — This (adjective form, used before a noun)

- 그 — That (adjective form, used before a noun)

- 저 — That over there (adjective form, used before a noun)

#### Grammar

- Korean demonstratives '이', '그', '저' are placed before nouns to indicate 'this', 'that', 'that over there' respectively, depending on the distance.

- '것' (thing) can be added to '이', '그', '저' to make '이것', '그것', '저것', or they can be used with nouns: 이 책 (this book), 그 펜 (that pen), 저 컴퓨터 (that computer over there).

---

#### Culture Note

Koreans often use spatial language to show respect. For example, when referring to someone else’s belongings, it is polite to use '저' (that over there) even if it is close, to show respect for the other person’s property.
