#### Grammar

In Korean, colors are used both as nouns and as adjectives. When used as adjectives, they need to be in the correct form to modify a noun.

1. **As Nouns**:

    - Colors can stand alone as nouns, for example, 파란색 (blue) and 노란색 (yellow).

2. **As Adjectives**:

    - When colors are used as adjectives directly before nouns, they take on a slightly different form, often dropping the 색 part. For example, 파란 셔츠 (blue shirt) instead of 파란색 셔츠.

    - Some colors have irregular adjective forms, like 빨간 for red when modifying a noun (빨간 사과 for red apple).

#### Culture Note

Colors in Korean culture often carry deep symbolism. For example, white (하얀색) is commonly associated with purity and is often worn at funerals, while red (빨간색) represents good fortune and is a popular color during celebrations and holidays.
