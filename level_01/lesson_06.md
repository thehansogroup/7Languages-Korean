#### Grammar

- In Korean, nouns do not change their form between singular and plural in most cases. Context usually indicates the plurality.

- The Korean language does not use articles like 'a' or 'the', but specificity can be implied with words like 이 (this) or 그 (that).

---

#### Culture Note

Some objects have cultural superstitions associated with them. For example, writing someone's name in red ink is avoided as it was traditionally associated with death.
