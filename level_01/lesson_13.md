## Grammar

The use of possessive pronouns in Korean is straightforward. To indicate possession, you simply add 의 to the noun.

- 제 (my) is a contraction of 저의, and is often used for smoother pronunciation.

- 당신의 (your) is not commonly used in Korean as it sounds very formal or can even be considered rude in some contexts. Instead, the relationship to the person is often used, such as 수민의 (Su-min's).

## Culture Note

In Korea, family is central to social life and identity. Hierarchical relationships play a significant role, and terms of address for family members reflect this. Terms like 형, 누나, 오빠, and 언니 are also used outside of the family to address friends and acquaintances who are older, as a sign of respect and closeness.
