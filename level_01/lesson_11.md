#### Grammar

When using adjectives in Korean, they typically precede the nouns they modify, and they must agree in tense and politeness level with the rest of the sentence. Here's how you can use the adjective with a noun:

1. **Using Adjectives Directly Before Nouns**:

    - If an adjective directly modifies a noun, it needs to be in its attributive form, which often involves adding the suffix `-ㄴ` or `-은`. For example, 크다 (to be big) becomes 큰 (big) when used before a noun, as in 큰 가방 (big bag).

    - If the adjective stem ends in a vowel, use `-ㄴ` to connect it to the noun (e.g., 작다 becomes 작은 when describing a noun, as in 작은 가방 for a small bag).

    - If the adjective stem ends in a consonant, use `-은` (e.g., 새로운 for new, as in 새로운 가방 for a new bag).

2. **Using 이다 with Adjectives**:

    - When you want to say something "is" an adjective, you use the copula verb 이다 (to be). For example, 가방이 크다 (The bag is big). Notice that the adjective comes before the verb and that the 이다 changes based on the politeness level and tense.

    - If the noun ends with a consonant, 이다 becomes 이에요/입니다 in present polite form (가방이 크다 becomes 가방이 커요/가방이 큽니다).

    - If the noun ends with a vowel, 이다 just becomes 예요/입니다 in present polite form (책이 작다 becomes 책이 작아요/책이 작습니다).

3. **Descriptive Verbs in the Past Tense**:

    - To describe past states, Korean uses the past tense of descriptive verbs (adjectives). 오래되다 (to be old) can be used in the past descriptive form to give the meaning of something that is old, such as in 오래된 가방 (an old bag).

#### Culture Note

Koreans value beauty and aesthetics, and this is often reflected in the language used to describe objects. An old object is not merely 오래된 but carries connotations of timelessness or a story behind it, reflecting the value placed on history and tradition.
