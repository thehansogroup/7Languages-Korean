## Culture Note

Korean names typically consist of a one-syllable family name followed by a two-syllable given name. Names carry significant meanings and are chosen with great care. Unlike in Western cultures, it’s customary to address someone using their full name plus an honorific, such as "씨," rather than just their given name, especially in formal or business settings.
